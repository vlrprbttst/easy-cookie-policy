# Easy cookie policy
This is a reusable module for adding a subtle banner to your website so you can show your compliance status regarding the new EU Cookie Law.

## Dependencies
Needs jquery. Any jQuery will do.

## How it works
I've left all stylings basic so you can customize it to fit in with your existing website.

`#info_cookie` contains the short version of your cookie policy, it also contains an **OK** button and a **LEARN MORE** button. Clicking the OK button (using the `.ok-cookie` class) will make the banner disappear and stay hidden as long as the cookie persists in the user's browser.

The cookie will expire in 365 days.
